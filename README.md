### Technical Writer, Systems Builder, and Open Source Creator

A self-taught systems builder passionate about modular systems, open-access documentation, and developer-centric tools. As the founder of the “openaccess” initiative, I created a public GitHub space for outliers, self-taught developers, and neurodivergent individuals who have faced challenges in traditional education. Unlike following templates, I build and document real tools in real time for real people.

If they take the repository—we fork it.
If they erase us—we leave proof in every commit.”
